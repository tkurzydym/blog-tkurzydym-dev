## Hello World

Hello out there! This is my Hello World!for my new Blog. 
I want to be more active in my online representation and well, what's the first thing that comes to mind? 
Correct, let's blog. 
I want to log my tech experiences as a Software Developer and use it to document knowledge for myself, 
but also provide a knowledge base to everyone else out there.
This includes common pitfalls, tips and tricks or known issues I stumble upon.

## Upcoming

I will try my best to write one entry every two weeks!
