My name is Tobias. I'm a Software Developer and -Architect.

I have mainly worked on enterprise applications following the Domain Driven Design approach and using frameworks like
Spring Boot and Quarkus.
Starting with monoliths, I have gone through different architecture variants and am currently working on a cloud-native
microservice platform.
More recently, I got more and more into Platform Engineering and Software Reliability Engineering, though my tech heart
still beats for the application development part of the job.
Over the years, I have grown a love for software craftsmanship and clean code.

In my spare time I enjoy being outside on my gravel bike or on the contrary being inside in my Sim Racing Cockpit and race online against other people on iRacing.
